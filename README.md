Skin Cancer Detection Web Application
This repository contains the code for a Skin Cancer Detection web application developed using FastAPI and TensorFlow. The application allows users to upload skin images for analysis and determines whether the skin condition is Benign or Malignant (i.e., skin cancer) using a pre-trained deep learning model.

Features:
Upload Image: Users can upload skin images, which are then processed and analyzed using a trained deep learning model.
Prediction: The system classifies the uploaded image as either "Benign" or "Malignant" with confidence percentages.
Blog Section: Provides informational articles related to skin cancer prevention, detection, and treatment.
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, with a user-friendly interface for both mobile and desktop users.
Image Preview: Users can see a preview of the uploaded image before prediction.
Technologies:
FastAPI: For building the backend of the web application.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for the pre-trained deep learning model to classify skin conditions.
HTML/CSS: For front-end design, making the page visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: To handle dynamic user interactions and communicate with the backend API.

Model:
The model used for detection is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained to recognize benign and malignant skin lesions. The model is loaded via TensorFlow and used for predictions on the uploaded images.
